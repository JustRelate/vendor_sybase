The context allocation routine failed when it tried to load localization files!!
One or more following problems may caused the failure

Your sybase home directory is /opt/sybase. Check the environment variable SYBASE if it is not the one you want!
Using locale name "de_DE.utf8" defined in environment variable LANG
Locale name "de_DE.utf8" doesn't exist in your /opt/sybase/locales/locales.dat file
